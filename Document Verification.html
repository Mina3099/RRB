                                 2.  Before filling up the online application, candidates are advised to read all the instructions and information carefully in the CEN available on the websites of RRBs.<br> <br>

                                 3.  Candidates are advised to visit only official websites of the RRBs and be very careful about fake websites and job racketeers.<br> <br>

                                 4.  Candidates should have their own mobile number, valid & active personal email id. They should keep them active for the entire duration of recruitment as RRBs shall send all recruitment related communications only through SMS and email till the recruitment is completely over. RRBs will not entertain any request for change of mobile number and email address at any stage.<br> <br>

                                 5.  Applications are to be submitted ONLINE ONLY and through the RRB websites ONLY. One application ONLY is required to be submitted to the selected RRB for all its notified posts in the CEN for that selected RRB. Candidates can apply to only one RRB. Application to more than one RRB, will lead to rejection of all the applications. Any attempt to submit more than one application by a candidate against the CEN shall result in disqualification and debarment.<br> <br>

                                 6.  Candidates are required to go through the Post Parameter Table and Vacancy Table and ascertain their eligibility. Only thereafter, the candidates should exercise options for the RRBs and post(s) within the chosen RRB as per their eligibility. The selection of RRB once exercised shall be final.<br> <br>

                                 7.  Eligibility of the candidates will be considered only on the strength of the information furnished in the ONLINE Application. Candidates need NOT send printouts of application or Certificates or copies to RRBs concerned by post. If at any stage of recruitment or thereafter, it is found that any information furnished by the candidate in his/her application is false/incorrect or the candidate has suppressed any relevant information or the candidate does not satisfy the eligibility criteria for the post(s), his/her candidature will be rejected.<br> <br>

                                 8.  Candidates must ensure that they fulfill the prescribed Medical Standards for the post(s) they are opting for. It is to be noted by the candidates that in case the candidate is found to be medically unsuitable for the opted post at the time of appointment, alternate appointment shall not be given.<br> <br>

                                9.  Center/City allocation for CBTs (computer based test) will depend upon technical and logistical feasibility. Candidates may have to travel to other Cities/States for attending CBTs. Request for Change of Exam Centre shall NOT be allowed under any circumstances.<br> <br>

                               10.  To avoid last minute rush, candidates are advised in their own interest to register and submit ONLINE application much before the closing date since there may be a possibility of inability/failure to log on to the website of RRB concerned on account of heavy load on the internet or website during last days of online registration. RRBs do not accept any responsibility for the candidates not being able to register and/or submit their application within the last day on account of aforesaid reasons or any other reason. <br> <br> <br>

                               <B>MALPRACTICES : </B> <br>
                               1.

He/she will also be debarred from getting any appointment in the Railways, and if already appointed, will be dismissed from service. Such candidates are also liable for legal action. <br> <br> <br>

                               <B>CALL LETTERS :</B> <br>
                               1.Candidates will have to download the City and Date Intimations, e-Call Letters and Travel Authority (wherever applicable) from the links provided on the official websites of RRBs. <br> <br> <br>

                               1. Admission to all stages of recruitment process shall be purely provisional, subject to the candidate satisfying the prescribed eligibility conditions.

2. Mere issue of e-Call letter to the candidates will NOT imply that their candidature has been finally accepted by the RRB.

3. RRBs conduct verification of eligibility conditions with reference to original documents only after the candidates have qualified in all the stages of examinations and are shortlisted for Document Verification. RRBs may reject the candidature of any applicant at any stage of recruitment process in case the candidate is found to be not fulfilling the requisite criteria and if appointed, such a candidate is liable to be removed from service summarily. <br> <br>

4. Before applying for the post(s) against this notification, candidates should satisfy themselves that they fulfill all the eligibility norms including age, educational qualification(s) and medical standard (s). Candidates should ensure that they have requisite educational / technical qualifications from recognized Board / University / Institute as on the closing date for online registration. Those awaiting results of the final examination for the prescribed qualification are not eligible and hence should not apply.<br> <br>

5. Applications of candidates who are attempting to apply with minor changes of information and /or facts to more than one RRB and/or multiple applications to the same RRB will be summarily rejected and such candidates will be debarred from all future examinations of RRB and RRC.<br><br>

7. Candidates should enter their Name, Father's Name and Date of Birth as recorded in the SSLC/Matriculation/High School Examination Certificate or an equivalent Certificate ONLY. In cases of name change, candidates should indicate their changed Name only in the ONLINE application. However, other details should match with the Matriculation or Equivalent certificate. Date of such change should be prior to the date of registration of ONLINE application. Gazette Notification or any other legal document as applicable for such cases should be submitted at the time of Document Verification (DV). <br> <br>

8. Dates of examinations will also be published on the websites of participating RRBs. The e-call letters for CBTs, Computer Based Aptitude Test, Typing Skill Test and Document Verification (as applicable) should be downloaded ONLY from websites of the Railway Recruitment Boards concerned. No call letter will be sent by post. The CBT Centre, date and shift indicated in the e-call letter shall be final. RRBs reserve the right to introduce additional CBTs / Typing Skill Test/ Aptitude Test and/or additional document verification etc., without assigning any reason. <br> <br>

9. Vacancies indicated in the CEN are provisional and may undergo any change (increase/ decrease) or even become NIL in total or in specific Railways / Units / Communities / Posts at a later stage depending upon the actual needs of the Railway Administration. Also, additional posts if required by the Railway(s) may also be included at later stage. The Railway Administration also reserves the right to cancel the notified vacancies at any stage at its discretion and such decision will be final and binding on all. In the event of cancellation of notified vacancies, the examination fee paid by the candidates will not be refunded except for candidates who have attended the 1 st Stage CBT. <br> <br>

10. PREFERENCE FOR POST(S) AND/OR RAILWAY(S) / UNIT(S) : <br>
The options from the candidates for various posts for which they are eligible in the opted RRB, shall be taken during submission of ONLINE applications. On completion of all stages of recruitment process, RRBs will allot Post & Railway/Unit as per the option of the eligible candidates ONLY subject to merit, medical standard and vacancy position. Once candidates have been empanelled as per their merit/choice, they will forfeit the right to be considered for any other post/category within the same level. Candidates with partial option will be considered only for the specific categories opted by them. In case, no option is given for certain posts, it would be considered as their unwillingness for the same. However, RRBs also reserve the right to allot Post/Railway/Unit not opted by the candidates, if considered necessary in administrative interest, subject to the candidate (s) meeting the requirements of the post allotted. <br> <br>

11. GENERAL POINTS : <br>
Selection by RRB does not confer upon candidates any right of appointment in the Railways. The function of the RRB is to recommend names of suitable candidates to the concerned authorities of the Zonal Railway/Production Unit who in turn will issue the offer of appointment letter subject to availability of vacancies and candidates satisfying all eligibility criteria including antecedents and character. <br> <br>

12.Free Sleeper Class Railway Pass is admissible to SC/ST candidates only. SC/ST candidates who wish to avail free travel authority will have to indicate Yes in the relevant column in the ONLINE application and upload valid caste certificate. For such candidates, free Sleeper Class Railway Pass will be a part of e-call letter when they are called for various stages of recruitment viz. CBT, Computer based Aptitude Test, Typing Skill Test, document verification etc. as per the details furnished and uploaded in ONLINE application. It is the responsibility of the candidates availing free travel authority to give the correct name of the Railway Station in online application, failing which their travel authority may not be valid for travel and obtaining reservation. At the time of obtaining reservation and travelling, the Reservation Clerk and/or Ticket Checking Staff will ask for the original SC/ST community certificate for verification of genuineness of the candidate. Any attempt to misuse this travelling authority shall lead to rejection of candidature at any stage of the recruitment process and debarment for future examinations conducted by RRBs/RRCs.<br> <br>

13.RRBs reserve the right to incorporate any subsequent changes / modifications / additions in the terms & conditions of recruitment under the CEN as necessitated and applicable.<br> <br>
